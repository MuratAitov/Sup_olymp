Project for class in Russia (2022)

In Russia, there is a system where you can get into top universities for free by winning an Olympiad in a specific field (for example, in economics). There are an incredible number of these Olympiads, and there is no centralized database indicating which Olympiads are required for admission to a particular university or program. My project addresses this issue. However, it currently only works for one university. When choosing a program at the university, it provides a complete list of Olympiads that need to be taken in order to qualify for that specific program. In the future, I plan to add a feature that allows the bot to automatically notify about upcoming Olympiads (registration and competition dates).
